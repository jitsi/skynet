    This method is used for splitting long audios into speech chunks using silero VAD

    Parameters
    ----------
    audio: torch.Tensor, one dimensional
        One dimensional float torch.Tensor, other types are casted to torch if possible

    model: preloaded .jit silero VAD model

    threshold: float (default - 0.5)
        Speech threshold. Silero VAD outputs speech probabilities for each audio chunk, probabilities ABOVE this value are considered as SPEECH.
        It is better to tune this parameter for each dataset separately, but "lazy" 0.5 is pretty good for most datasets.

    sampling_rate: int (default - 16000)
        Currently silero VAD models support 8000 and 16000 sample rates

    min_speech_duration_ms: int (default - 250 milliseconds)
        Final speech chunks shorter min_speech_duration_ms are thrown out

    max_speech_duration_s: int (default -  inf)
        Maximum duration of speech chunks in seconds
        Chunks longer than max_speech_duration_s will be split at the timestamp of the last silence that lasts more than 100s (if any), to prevent agressive cutting.
        Otherwise, they will be split aggressively just before max_speech_duration_s.

    min_silence_duration_ms: int (default - 100 milliseconds)
        In the end of each speech chunk wait for min_silence_duration_ms before separating it

    window_size_samples: int (default - 1536 samples)
        Audio chunks of window_size_samples size are fed to the silero VAD model.
        WARNING! Silero VAD models were trained using 512, 1024, 1536 samples for 16000 sample rate and 256, 512, 768 samples for 8000 sample rate.
        Values other than these may affect model perfomance!!

    speech_pad_ms: int (default - 30 milliseconds)
        Final speech chunks are padded by speech_pad_ms each side

    return_seconds: bool (default - False)
        whether return timestamps in seconds (default - samples)

    progress_tracking_callback: Callable[[float], None] (default - None)
        callback function taking progress in percents as an argument

    Returns
    ----------
    speeches: list of dicts
        list containing ends and beginnings of speech chunks (samples or seconds based on return_seconds)
