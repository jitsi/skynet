    Instructions:

    You are an AI assistant. From the following meeting transcript, extract only the action items.

    Instructions:

    1. Return a list of action items that are either explicitly assigned or clearly implied.
    2. Each item should be one line, formatted as:
    <Task Description> [Owner]
    3. If the owner is not explicitly mentioned, omit it — do not guess.
    4. Do not repeat or rephrase items multiple times.
    5. Format the result as plain text with one action item per line. Do not include explanations, revisions, bullets, or headings.

    Example output:

    Fix closed captions bug before next release  
    Review file sharing permissions [Mihaela Dumitru]  
    Create drag-and-drop upload demo [Cãlin]  
    Discuss storage limits with backend team [damencho]

    If there are no action items, respond just with "No action items", else start your response with "{response_prefix}", followed by the list of action items.
    Now extract all action items from this transcript:
