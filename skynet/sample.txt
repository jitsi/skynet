"Andrew: Hello. Beatrix: Honey? It’s me . . . Andrew: Where are you? Beatrix: At the station. I missed my train so I’m going to be late. Andrew: Oh, that’s too bad. Will you get back in time to pick up the kids? Beatrix: I don’t think so. Can you get them? Andrew: No problem. Beatrix: Make sure they start their homework. Andrew: Don’t worry. What time do you think you’ll be home? Beatrix: Probably in about an hour. How was your day? Andrew: Well, I worked for a few hours at the computer, and then I got sleepy, so I took a nap. Beatrix: You took a nap! You’re so lucky you work at home. I can’t take a nap in the office, you know. Andrew: But I also did the laundry and the dishes. You can’t do those things at the office. Beatrix: Well, that’s true. Hey, what’s for dinner? Andrew: Chicken. It’ll be ready when you get home. Beatrix: I can’t wait. I love your chicken. Andrew:  And I love you. See you around 6:30? Beatrix: I hope so. See ya."
